In this study, we use falconry-trained goshawks (Accipiter atricapillus) to experimentally evaluate how raptors perceive white and brown lures in snowy and bare ground conditions and assess how motion and habitat influence attack distance. 

### Analysis Summary
We fitted linear mixed effects models to relate attack distance (m) to mismatch and habitat structure. Attack distance (y, meters) was the response in all models, and all models included a random intercept Î±_j accounting for individual variation between goshawks. Fixed effects include mismatch as an interaction between two covariates: lure color (x_1) and ground color (x_2), learning (x_3i) represented by ordered trial number for each individual bird, and habitat structure (x_4, open or forest). Moving lure and stationary model trials were analyzed separately given differences in experiment format.

### Variables

**ID**: Goshawk name

**Order**: Ordered number of repeated experimental trial starting at 1 and repeating with every individual trial. Moving lure and stationary model trials are each numbered separately beginning at 1.

**Rep**: 1 or 2 reflects whether this individual trial was the first or 2nd repetition at each experiment location (trials were repeated once with each color model/lure at each location. initial color was randomly selected for each location prior to experiments).

**Loc**: Ordered experiment location numbers (locations selected opportunistically in the field by the falconer). Since trials were repeated once with each color model/lure at each location, for each Location there are 2 Reps.

**Cover**:    O - Open habitat (Meadow with dead grass)     
              F - Forest habitat (Ponderosa forest with sparse understory)

**Ground**:   B - Brown, bare ground  
              W - White, snowy ground

**Lure**:     B - Brown wild-type agouti rabbit pelt    
              W - White rabbit pelt

**Motion**:   M - Moving lure  
              S - Stationary model

**Dist**: Attack distance (meters) or distance between hawk take-off and lure/model capture location.
